Dear students,
Attached, you will find a C source file containing various ways of using some of the variants of the exec() function.
You can use it in conjunction with the fork() function to generate new subprocesses able to execute various other commands.

2. Are able to launch in execution all the commands received at execution (similar to a mini CLI/Bash).
